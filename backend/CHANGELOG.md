# Changelog

All notable changes to this backend will be documented in this file.

## 2025-10-18

- docs: Rewrote `DEPLOYMENT.md` to fix markdownlint errors (single H1, valid headings, proper code fences, obfuscated plain emails); no runtime changes.
- docs: Added `.markdownlintignore` to ignore `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `uploads/`, `ssl/`, and `docs/archive/` from lint checks.
- docs: Archived legacy backup `DEPLOYMENT.md.backup` under `docs/archive/` and removed duplicate at repository root (kept the archived copy). No code changes.
- chore: No functional or runtime modifications. Lint, type-check, and build continue to pass.
